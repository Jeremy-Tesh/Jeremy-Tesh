### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Web3 Engineer. Initially, I worked as a web and mobile developer. Later, I became captivated by blockchain technology and its enormous potential. I looked into the realm of dApps, but as my drive to learn grew, I wound up creating dApps on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchains. Now that I have a better understanding of the Web3 domain, I hope to put my extensive educational experience in the subject as well as my potent technical and programming skills to use.
